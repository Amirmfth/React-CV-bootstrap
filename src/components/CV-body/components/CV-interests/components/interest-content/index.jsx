        Apart from being a web developer, surprisingly I'm a huge sportFan. as
        an outdoor activity I mostly play Football with my friends or play
        billiard ,though i must say i am a novice
      </p>
      <p className="mb-0">
        but for indoor activity , I do various stuff like making music(which I
        love the most) , studying about management and business or learn new
        languages. I love being in my own house and my own room,and frankly, I
        see my self as an introverted person
